The package provides a framework for analyzing data from multivariate
point processes in time or one-dimensional space, aka marked point
processes with discrete marks, based on a specification of the
conditional intensity process. The main function is
\code{\link{pointProcessModel}}, which constructs and fits a
generalized linear point process model to a dataset. The data need to be
stored as an object of S4-class
\code{\linkS4class{MarkedPointProcess}}. A \code{MarkedPointProcess}
object can hold data from a marked point process as well as additional
(covariate) continuous processes. Other functions are
\code{\link{ppSmooth}} and \code{\link{ppKernel}} that implement
non-parametric estimaton of linear filter functions.

The data structures for continuous and marked point processes are
implemented in the separate package \code{\link{processdata}}.
